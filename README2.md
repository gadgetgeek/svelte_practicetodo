# Project 4 - Daily Dids v.2.svelte
#### By Brian Anderson

## Project Summary

I'm building a version 2 of daily did app - that is a tracker for what i did to keep growing per Alex's markdown.  It incorporate all 7 restful routes.  My goals for this app are
1. Responsive 
2. Track what was done
3. stopwatch like feature

## Models

I believe there is just one.  I would like to add one or two more once I complete this project.

## Route Table

List your routes in a table

| url | method | action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| /dids | get | get all "dids" (index)|
| /dids/:id | get | get a particular did (show)|
| /dids/new | get | show "add new" did form  (new)|
| /dids | post | add the new did to database (create)|
| /dids /:id/edit| get | show form to edit existing did  (edit)|
| /dids/:id | put | change database to update did (update)|
| /dids/:id | delete | remove the did from database (destroy)|

## User Stories
Our user is someone who aspires to be as Gouda as Alex Merced...but skill level is fairly Cheesy. Our user needs to follow AM's advice and continue to put in the 8 hours a day to get there.  Our user will:
- add did's to the list as necessary
- add or edit did's/minutes if desired
- delete did as they want
